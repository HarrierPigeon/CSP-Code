# Part One

## Fofx(x)
**Code, First try:**
```python
def fofx(x):
	if int(x) != x:
		print(x, 'is not an integer')
	elif (x % 2) == 0:
		if (x % 3) != 0:
			print(x,'is even.')
		else:
			print(x,'is a multiple of six.')
```
**Output [iPython], before zerofix**
```python
	In [11]: fofx(0)
	0 is a multiple of six.
```
*Not* what we want.


**Code, after Zero Fix**
``` python
def fofx(x):
	if int(x) != x:
		print(x, 'is not an integer')
	elif (x % 2) == 0:
		if x == 0:
			print(x,'is even') # Zero is not a multiple of six.
		elif (x % 3) != 0:
			print(x,'is even.')
	else:
		print(x,'is a multiple of six.')
```

**Output [iPython], after zerofix**
```python
		In [13]: fofx(0)
		0 is even
		In [14]: fofx(1)
		(didn't return anything)
```
I forgot to add part of the flowchart.  Oops.

### ** Final Code**
```python
def fofx(x):
	if int(x) != x:
		print(x, 'is not an integer')
	elif (x % 2) == 0:
		if x == 0:
			print(x,'is even') # Zero is not a multiple of six, but is even.
		elif (x % 3) != 0:
			print(x,'is even.')
		else:
			print(x,'is a multiple of six.')
	else:
		print(x,'is odd')

```

**Output [iPython], after making odds show up.**
```python
	In [16]: fofx(0)
	0 is even

	In [17]: fofx(1)
	1 is odd

	In [18]: fofx(2)
	2 is even.

	In [19]: fofx(6)
	6 is a multiple of six.

	In [20]: fofx(3)
	3 is odd
```

# Part 2

## guess_once()
**Original Code**
```python
	def guess_once():
    secret = random.randint(1, 4)
    print('I have a number between 1 and 4.')
    guess = int(raw_input('Guess: '))
    if guess != secret:
        print('Wrong, my number is ', secret, '.', sep='')
    else:
        print('Right, my number is', 
        	guess, end='!\n')
```

### **Final Code**
```python
def guess_once():
    secret = random.randint(1, 4)
    print('I have a number between 1 and 4.')
    guess = int(raw_input('Guess: '))
    if guess != secret:
        highorlow = ""
        if guess > secret:
            highorlow = 'high,'
        else:
            highorlow = 'low,'
        print('Too',highorlow,'my number was',secret)            
    else:
        print('Right, my number is', guess, end='!\n')
```

**Output [iPython]**
```python
In [51]: guess_once()
I have a number between 1 and 4.

Guess: 1
Too low, my number was 3

In [52]: guess_once()
I have a number between 1 and 4.

Guess: 1
Right, my number is 1!

In [53]: guess_once()
I have a number between 1 and 4.

Guess: 4
Too high, my number was 3
```
