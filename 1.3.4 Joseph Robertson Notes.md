# Part 1
### Inputs:

 - Line 15 gets executed when the fruit is citrus.
 - Line 17 gets executed
   when the fruit isn't citrus.
 -  Line 20 gets executed if the food isn't fruit, and is starchy.
 - Line 22 gets executed if the food isn't fruit and isn't starchy.
``Bananas`` are a ``fruit``, which gets checked first.

``fofx``- I added another conditional to make sure that zero wasn't falsely reported as a multiple of six.

# Part 2
```python
	import random
	secret = random.randint(1, 4) _# picks random number_
```
